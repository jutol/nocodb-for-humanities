## Data Sets

FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop
